# viewport

# Control the size and orientation of the screen for your application.

# You can set the viewportâ€™s width and height globally by defining viewportWidth and viewportHeight in the configuration.

$ 'Syntax'

# cy.viewport (width, height)

# cy.viewport (preset, orientation)

# cy.viewport (width, height, options)

# cy.viewport(preset, orientation, options)

-$ Usage

# Correct Usage

cy.viewport(550, 750)    // Set viewport to 550px x 750px
cy.viewport('iphone-6')  // Set viewport to 375px x 667px
Arguments
 width (Number)

# Width of viewport in pixels (must be a non-negative, finite number).

 height (Number)

# Height of viewport in pixels (must be a non-negative, finite number).

 preset (String)

# A preset dimension to set the viewport. Preset supports the following options:

Preset	width	height
ipad-2	768	1024
ipad-mini	768	1024
iphone-3	320	480
iphone-4	320	480
iphone-5	320	568
iphone-6	375	667
iphone-6+	414	736
iphone-7	375	667
iphone-8	375	667
iphone-x	375	812
iphone-xr	414	896
iphone-se2	375	667
macbook-11	1366	768
macbook-13	1280	800
macbook-15	1440	900
macbook-16	1536	960
samsung-note9	414	846
samsung-s10	360	760
 orientation (String)

# The orientation of the screen. The default orientation is portrait. Pass landscape as the orientation to reverse the width/height.

 options (Object)

# Pass in an options object to change the default behavior of cy.viewport().

# Option	Default	Description

log	true	Displays the command in the Command log

# Yields 

cy.viewport() yields null.

cy.viewport() cannot be chained further.

# Examples
Width, Height
Resize the viewport to 1024px x 768px
cy.viewport(1024, 768)
Organize desktop vs mobile tests separately
describe('Nav Menus', () => {
  context('720p resolution', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      // run these tests as if in a desktop
      // browser with a 720p monitor
      cy.viewport(1280, 720)
    })

    it('displays full header', () => {
      cy.get('nav .desktop-menu').should('be.visible')
      cy.get('nav .mobile-menu').should('not.be.visible')
    })
  })

  context('iphone-5 resolution', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      // run these tests as if in a mobile browser
      // and ensure our responsive UI is correct
      cy.viewport('iphone-5')
    })

    it('displays mobile menu on click', () => {
      cy.get('nav .desktop-menu').should('not.be.visible')
      cy.get('nav .mobile-menu')
        .should('be.visible')
        .find('i.hamburger').click()

      cy.get('ul.slideout-menu').should('be.visible')
    })
  })
})
Dynamically test multiple viewports
const sizes = ['iphone-6', 'ipad-2', [1024, 768]]

describe('Logo', () => {
  sizes.forEach((size) => {
    // make assertions on the logo using
    // an array of different viewports
    it(`Should display logo on ${size} screen`, () => {
      if (Cypress._.isArray(size)) {
        cy.viewport(size[0], size[1])
      } else {
        cy.viewport(size)
      }

      cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io')
      cy.get('#logo').should('be.visible')
    })
  })
})
Command Log of multiple viewports
Preset
Resize the viewport to iPhone 6 width and height
cy.viewport('iphone-6') // viewport will change to 414px x 736px
Orientation
Change the orientation to landscape
// the viewport will now be changed to 736px x 414px
// and simulates the user holding the iPhone in landscape
cy.viewport('iphone-6', 'landscape')
Notes
devicePixelRatio
devicePixelRatio is not simulated
This is something Cypress will eventually do, which will match how Chromeâ€™s responsive mobile browsing simulation works. Follow #7075 if you need this supported.

Restores
Cypress will restore the viewport in the snapshot
When hovering over each command, Cypress will automatically display the snapshot in the viewport dimensions that existed when that command ran.

Defaults
Default sizing
By default, until you issue a cy.viewport() command, Cypress sets the width to 1000px and the height to 660px by default.

You can change these default dimensions by adding the following to your configuration file (cypress.json by default):

{
  "viewportWidth": 1000,
  "viewportHeight": 660
}
Additionally, Cypress automatically sets the viewport to its default size between each test.

Scaling
Auto Scaling
By default, if your screen is not large enough to display all of the current dimensionâ€™s pixels, Cypress will scale and center your application within the Cypress runner to accommodate.

Scaling the app should not affect any calculations or behavior of your application (in fact it wonâ€™t even know itâ€™s being scaled).

The upsides to this are that tests should consistently pass or fail regardless of a developersâ€™ screen size. Tests will also consistently run in CI because all of the viewports will be the same no matter what machine Cypress runs on.

Reset viewport via Cypress.config()
You can change the size of the viewport height and width for the remainder of the tests by setting the new values for viewportHeight or viewportWidth within Cypress.config().

Cypress.config('viewportWidth', 800)
Cypress.config('viewportWidth') // => 800
Set viewport in the test configuration
You can configure the size of the viewport height and width within a suite or test by passing the new configuration value within the test configuration.

This will set the height and width throughout the duration of the tests, then return it to the default viewportHeight and viewportWidth when complete.

describe('page display on medium size screen', {
  viewportHeight: 1000,
  viewportWidth: 400
}, () => {
  it('does not display sidebar', () => {
    cy.get('#sidebar').should('not.be.visible')
  })

  it('shows hamburger menu', () => {
    cy.get('#header').find('i.menu').should('be.visible')
  })
})
Rules
Requirements 
cy.viewport() requires being chained off of cy.

Assertions 
cy.viewport() cannot have any assertions chained.

Timeouts 
cy.viewport() cannot time out.

Command Log
Change viewport size to test responsive nav

cy.get('#navbar').should('be.visible')

cy.viewport(320, 480)

// the navbar should have collapse since our screen is smaller
cy.get('#navbar').should('not.be.visible')
cy.get('.navbar-toggle').should('be.visible').click()
cy.get('.nav').find('a').should('be.visible')
The commands above will display in the Command Log as:

Command Log viewport
When clicking on viewport within the command log, the console outputs the following:
